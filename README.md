# LevelUpSpells
A small WoW Classic addon that tells you what spells you can learn at which level. I made it because I want to know when to go to the trainer and when I can skip it. I could have just made a list, but whatever.

## Features
* Notifies you about newly available spells when you reach a new level.
* Shows cost of spells, or whether it's learned from a quest or from a book.
* If learned from a book it also tells where it drops, if it's a specific place (e.g. AQ20 books).
* Only shows spells you can actually learn. This means you have the base talent, correct race and faction, and the classic phase has it available.
* **/lus missig** To tell you all the spells you are missing up to your currect level.
* **/lus \<level\>** To tell you what spells are available at the given level.

**On level up:**

### Note
Tested on stress test and seems to work fine. Spell lists were generated by a script from DB sites and pserver DBs and looked over by hand a few minutes each, so they may still be incomplete or have wrong data!

Pet spells are unsupported, didn't even plan it because I won't play hunter or WL. MAYBE I'll add it later if I feel like it and there's at least 1 person who needs that.
